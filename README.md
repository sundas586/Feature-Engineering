# Feature Engineering

<h4> A process of extracting useful features from raw data using Maths, Statisics, Domain knowledge.</h4>

Feature engineering helps in data cleaning,
We do feature engineering before the data is put in machine learning model

some of its examples are

- Outlier detection
- imputation = the process of replacing missing data with substituted values.  Handling missing values
- One hot encoding 
- New feature creation = Two features as one, saves time, memory, Price and sq.ft --> price/sq.ft
